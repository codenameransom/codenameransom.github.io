My journey to even start and learn programming has been a long one, from trying to learn scratch as a kid to trying my hand at college for a CS degree. I have always been into computers no matter what it was building them, trying to create a batch virus(which was sorry excuse for a virus), to trying to make mods for games such as Modern Warfare 2 and Skyrim. My very first taste in programming wasn't a very good one as a kid i originally went to after school program my mom signed me up for that taught me Scratch a programming language for kids that was supposedly really easy. Well **NOT FOR ME** i struggled so much with the concepts and just thought that this was way too hard for me and never returned to the program(i still have nightmares of that dreaded cat).![](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/jamies-smash/images/f/f9/Scratch_Cat.png/revision/latest/top-crop/width/360/height/450?cb=20180413200848http://)
Years have gone by and i am about 16 and i had the bright idea to drop out of High School! Smart i know.... but thats besides the point i did nothing for about three years trying my hand at different jobs and not staying at them. Literally i got a job at Papa Johns and i didn't even return to work after the first day(Sorry Papa Johns i owe you one!). After failing at life multiple times i decided hey maybe a high school diploma will make life a lot easier. So i decided to join an online program called *Penn Foster* a online school that enabled me to get a high school diploma and not a GED, which there is nothing wrong with a GED but i just wanted to do this route. SO i got my diploma graduated with a 3.4 GPA (go me) and thought "What now ?".. So i thought "hmm mm" maybe i should go to college, so i did! God, it was the worst mistake i have done in my life. I had joined a C++ class and guess what that teacher did?? You guessed it. READ OFF THE PowerPoint!!!! no help just stood there, But i did learn some concepts on my own with this class thanks to my awesome piers. In the end it left another bad taste in my mouth about programming. I knew i wanted to do it but i just didn't know how. I didn't know which language to start with, what is a front end?, what is a back end?... i didn't know anything. So i dropped out of college and pursued my now job as CNA which as time went by i hated... I thought to myself "this can't be how life is, it can't be this boring, it can't be this draining to get out of bed and go do something you hate everyday, The pay cant be this low again...". Can it ? **BOOM** just like that my life flipped upside down and i found out that i was having a daughter at 21 and i knew i had to change fast. i could not be a dead beat that makes just above min wage, i have to better myself and lead as an example. So i decided to take free online courses on the site called freecodecamp, and it taught me more than any college class could and i started to really love it(even dream about it! Weird i know). I learned a solid foundation for HTML, CSS, and very basic JavaScript. At this point i started to get lost again, and really needed that guidance and the help from peers. Eventually, i stumbled across a website called FLATIRON! yah, this very website. I looked up reviews and saw the statistics, and i was astonished on the amount of people getting employed from just going to a coding boot camp. SO i was like "i need to get into this boot camp this is the one" and here i am writing this very blog. I have not been this determined ever! i just want to learn more. Programming has unlocked a piece of me that was locked a stowed away in a very dark place...now i can see the light at the end of the tunnel and it is only going to get brighter from here. I don't know what took me so long to get to this point but i am sure glad i finally got here.  It's been challenging but nothing is really fun without a challenge.
